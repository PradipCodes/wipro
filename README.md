This github repository contains learning material for Wipro Talent Next Program. These materials are extracted from Wipro PBL App. I will update it from time to time and I will also try to upload solutions for Hand in Assignments and Mini Projects.
These repository contains folders and subolders. Before moving to other folders, please finish all the sub-folders in a folder continouesly. To make it easy, I have numbered all the files.
